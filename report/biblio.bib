This layered structure constitutes the skeleton through which the force chains set up. Given the granular packing, and the region where the force is applied, such a skeleton is uniquely defined. Within this framework, we write an equation for the transmission of the vertical forces that can be solved recursively layer by layer. We find that a special class of analytical solutions for this equation are Lévi-stable distributions. We discuss the link between criticality and fragility and we show how the disordered packing naturally induces the formation of force-chains and arches. We point out that critical regimes, with power law distributions, are associated with the roughness of the topological layers. Whereas, fragility is associated with local changes in the force network induced by local granular rearrangements or by changes in the applied force. The results are compared with recent experimental observations in particulate matter and with computer simulations.},

            In a Bayesian analysis of finite mixture models, parameter estimation and clustering are sometimes less straightforward than might be expected. In particular, the common practice of estimating parameters by their posterior mean, and summarizing joint posterior distributions by marginal distributions, often leads to nonsensical answers. This is due to the so-called ‘label switching’ problem, which is caused by symmetry in the likelihood of the model parameters. A frequent response to this problem is to remove the symmetry by using artificial identifiability constraints. We demonstrate that this fails in general to solve the problem, and we describe an alternative class of approaches, relabelling algorithms, which arise from attempting to minimize the posterior expected loss under a class of loss functions. We describe in detail one particularly simple and general relabelling algorithm and illustrate its success in dealing with the label switching problem on two examples.},

            Composite development indicators used in policy making often subjectively aggregate a restricted set of indicators. We show, using dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and for the first time information filtering and hierarchical clustering, that these composite indicators miss key information on the relationship between different indicators. In particular, the grouping of indicators via topics is not reflected in the data at a global and local level. We overcome these issues by using the clustering of indicators to build a new set of cluster driven composite development indicators that are objective, data driven, comparable between countries, and retain interpretabilty. We discuss their consequences on informing policy makers about country development, comparing them with the top PageRank indicators as a benchmark. Finally, we demonstrate that our new set of composite development indicators outperforms the benchmark on a dataset reconstruction task.},

In particular in the case of planar filtered graphs (genus equal to 0), triangular loops and four-element cliques are formed. The application of this filtering procedure to 100 stocks in the U.S. equity markets shows that such loops and cliques have important and significant relationships with the market structure and properties.},

Its main advantage is that its CPU cost is linear in \$N\$, the original sample size, and is constant in \$M\$, the required size for the compressed sample. This compares favourably to Stein thinning {\textbackslash}citep\{Riabiz2020\}, which has complexity \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(NM{\textasciicircum}2)\$, and which requires the availability of the gradient of the target log-density (which automatically implies the availability of control variates).

We establish the convergence and complexity tradeoffs for several settings of KSD Thinning as a function of the KSD threshold parameter, sample size, and other problem parameters. Finally, we provide experimental comparisons against other online nonparametric Bayesian methods that generate low-complexity posterior representations, and observe superior consistency/complexity tradeoffs.

However, for complex statistical models, the stable numerical computation of derivatives can require bespoke algorithmic development and render Stein discrepancies impractical. This paper focuses on posterior approximation using Stein discrepancies, and introduces a collection of non-canonical Stein discrepancies that are gradient-free, meaning that derivatives of the statistical model are not required.

To address this limitation, we next provide sufficient conditions under which alternative diffusion KSDs control both moment and weak convergence. As an immediate consequence we develop, for each q {\textgreater} 0, the first KSDs known to exactly characterize q-Wasserstein convergence.},

	abstract = {Stein thinning is a promising algorithm proposed by Riabiz et al. [2022] for postprocessing outputs of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The main principle is to greedily minimize the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD), which only requires the gradient of the log-target distribution, and is thus well-suited for Bayesian inference. The main advantages of Stein thinning are the automatic remove of the burn-in period, the correction of the bias introduced by recent MCMC algorithms, and the asymptotic properties of convergence towards the target distribution. Nevertheless, Stein thinning suffers from several empirical pathologies, which may result in poor approximations, as observed in the literature. In this article, we conduct a theoretical analysis of these pathologies, to clearly identify the mechanisms at stake, and suggest improved strategies. Then, we introduce the regularized Stein thinning algorithm to alleviate the identified pathologies. Finally, theoretical guarantees and extensive experiments show the high efficiency of the proposed algorithm. An implementation of regularized Stein thinning as the kernax library in python and JAX is available at https://gitlab.com/drti/kernax.},

	abstract = {Importance sampling is a powerful tool for correcting the distributional mismatch in many statistical and machine learning problems, but in practice its performance is limited by the usage of simple proposals whose importance weights can be computed analytically. To address this limitation, Liu and Lee (2017) proposed a Black-Box Importance Sampling (BBIS) algorithm that computes the importance weights for arbitrary simulated samples by minimizing the kernelized Stein discrepancy. However, this requires knowing the score function of the target distribution, which is not easy to compute for many Bayesian problems. Hence, in this paper we propose another novel BBIS algorithm using minimum energy design, BBIS-MED, that requires only the unnormalized density function, which can be utilized as a post-processing step to improve the quality of Markov Chain Monte Carlo samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness and wide applicability of our proposed BBIS-MED algorithm on extensive simulations and a real-world Bayesian model calibration problem where the score function cannot be derived analytically.},

A novel method is proposed, based on greedy minimisation of a kernel Stein discrepancy, that is suitable when the gradient of the log-target can be evaluated and approximation using a small number of states is required.

            The algorithm of Metropolis et al.

Much recent research has been devoted to increasing the efficiency of simulation algorithms by altering the jumping rules for Metropolis-like algorithms. We study a very specific question: What are the most efficient symmetric jumping kernels for simulating a normal target distribution using the Metropolis algorithmã We provide a general theoretical result as the dimension of a class of canonical problems goes to ∞ and numerical approximations and simulations for low-dimensional Gaussian target distributions that show that the limiting results provide extremely accurate approximations in six and higher dimensions.},
